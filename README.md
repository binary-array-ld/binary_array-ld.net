## Binary Array Linked Data

Binary array linked data is a community effort to manage large quantities of large volume data sets, comprised of arrays of numberical data.

Binary array linked data attempts to provide tools and techniques to interpret the metadata of such data payloads whilst keeping the bulk of the information encoded within the binary containers.

Binary array linked data promotes linked data principles and publishing strategies for metadata.

## Open Geospatial Consortium 

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) are sponsors of the efforts to make specific encoding standards to support Binary Array Linked data across a number of binary data formats.
